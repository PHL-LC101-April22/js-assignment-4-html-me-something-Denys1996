            <p>When we make the decision to get married, the first question we have to consternate ourselves is "Where
               are we going to get married, USA or Mexico?"
            </p>
            <p>My family previously requested a visa to be able to travel to the US but it was denied, having that
               situation as a response we decided to have our wedding in Mexico.</p>
            <p>Now which part of Mexico? I (Denys) am from the State of Mexico in a small town in the middle of nowhere
               and far
               from the airport, so having our wedding there was not an option, but previously with Dan and
               family we have traveled to Merida and Cancun, and we loved Merida so we decided to have our wedding in
               Merida since it is a place that many people do not know or do not dare to go on their own.</p>
            <p>When we started to organize our wedding, one of our concerns was the flights to Merida, the flights were
               very precise with a single stop of less than 2 hours, but when we were 6 months before our wedding, the
               flights began to rise a lot in price. and with more than one stop and/or stops of more than 5 hours, so
               my husband and I decided to tell our guests to travel to Cancun from Philadelphia (4 hours) and from
               there we will have a private bus to go to Merida ( 4hrs), a total trip of 8 hrs. My husband and I feel
               lucky to have friends and family who were able to make the trip to be with us on such a special day.
